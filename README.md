# Audio Storage & Playback Application

This application provides a complete solution for users to upload audio files to a server and play them back through a web interface. The system is containerized using Docker Compose for easy deployment and consists of multiple components working together.

## System Architecture

The application consists of several key components:

1. **Frontend**: React-based web application for user interaction
2. **Backend**: API service that handles business logic and integration
3. **Keycloak**: Authentication and authorization server
4. **MinIO**: Object storage for audio files
5. **MongoDB**: Database for storing audio metadata
6. **PostgreSQL**: Database for Keycloak

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/larrytanjj/audio-file-hosting.git
cd audio-file-hosting

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d
```

Once all containers are running, you can access the application at http://localhost:3000

## Component Details

### Frontend
The frontend is a React-based web application that provides:
- User authentication through Keycloak
- Audio file upload interface
- Audio playback functionality
- Audio file management

### Backend API
The backend API provides:
- REST endpoints for audio management
- Integration with MinIO for file storage
- Integration with MongoDB for metadata storage
- Authentication via Keycloak

### Keycloak
Keycloak provides:
- User authentication and authorization
- User management
- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect support
- Custom realm configuration (loaded from realm-export.json)

### MinIO
MinIO provides:
- S3-compatible object storage
- Scalable and reliable storage for audio files
- Web-based console for storage management
- Anonymous download access to the audio bucket

### MongoDB
MongoDB stores:
- Audio file metadata
- User preferences
- Application data
- The audio collection is automatically created during initialization

## Development

To modify or extend the application:

1. Frontend code is located in `./frontend/audio-web-application`
2. Backend code is located in `./backend/audio-backend`
3. Keycloak realm configuration is in `./realm-export.json`

## Stopping the Application

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To remove all data volumes:
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## Security Notes

This setup is configured for development purposes:
- Keycloak is running in development mode
- MongoDB has no authentication enabled
- Passwords are set in plain text in the docker-compose file
